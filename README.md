# Competitive Programming Practices
My repository for programming problems on Codeforces and Atcoder.

## Resources
I've been solving problems on this compilated Google Sheets created by Dr.Mostafa Saad. In my opinion, pretty good compilation to get kickstarted on Division 2 Problems on Codeforces. 
[Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=1160016643)

This Competitive Programmer's Handbook is pretty useful to get started too.
